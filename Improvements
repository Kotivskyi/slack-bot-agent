 MAKE sure Logfire works
 DB request are read only
 Pipulate DB with some data
How streaming will effect scalability?
Setup Architecture Rules and others

Which SQL attacks exists ??
Do I need Sandboxing?
Unit Test

Evals
Local Dev Setup
Infractructure as a code
How CSV download will work?

Manual Tests:
- analytics requests
- context enryment
- Offscope request
- show SQL query
- CSV request
- Large CSV request (10000 items)
- Write request to DB

Improvements:
- Celery + Reddis: Rate limits,  caching, Task Queues
- Job to pupulate AppMetrics

Features: 
- More robust app Metrics (Multiple Currencies, Separation between Aquisition sources, also revenue types )

UX Improvements:
- Slack proceszing Status
- Implement Streaming
- Analytics Info DB is External + Validation
- Data retention policy

- AWS cost limits
- Inference cost limits
- Agent Runtime Sandbox
- CI pipeline
- CD pipeline
- Prompt Management
- Online Evaluation:
  - Customer Statisfaction (like/dislike)
  - Toxisite
  - Relevance

- Offline Evaluation: 
    - Quick during developmm
    - Full (on CI / Release Pipeline)
- Release Pipeline
- LiteLLM:
    - cost tracking
    - backup models
    - backup inference providers
